# FB-AutoPoker
A very, very simple autopoker for facebook.

Paste the contents of AutoPoker.js into console on your poke page, and then run autoPoke() once. Sit back, and enjoy.

This is a very simplistic approach in auto-poking, as it requires one to keep the facebook poke page open for as long as one wants to operate the autopoker. I'm sure there are many better ways to go about implementing it, but this works so I'm not complaining.
